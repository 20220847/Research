I got really inspired with code below as it help me a lot with my calculation and before learning this code I had to use google and try random websites. Now I dont even need internet connection and I shared with code with my dad and he was really happy watching me learn this. 

# Taking kilometers input from the user
kilometers = float(input("Enter value in kilometers: "))

# conversion factor
conv_fac = 0.621371

# calculate miles
miles = kilometers * conv_fac
print('%0.2f kilometers is equal to %0.2f miles' %(kilometers,miles))
